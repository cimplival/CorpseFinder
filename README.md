# A Failed Idea - CorpseFinder 

I looked at the time on my phone and it was 1500hrs. I had just entered the gates of probably the most cold chilling place in Nairobi. Thi place was the Nairobi City Mortuary. Why I found myself going to this place is probably a reason that no other person haves when going here.

I had gone to test an idea - Corpse finder. An idea that had lied in my mind ever since high school. The idea involved the dead. Yes, as the name suggests, the idea was about finding dead bodies. It may have been a strange idea but I recounted instances such as the Westgate Mall Terror Attack as well as the Garrisa University Attack where I thought this idea would have faired well. Overall, CorpseFinder was to be a platfrom (web) that allowed for the identification of dead bodies. It would save time and resources for the families of the deceased in looking for their lost ones. And so back then, a couple of friends thought that this was untapped. I even went a step further to build an html static page.

I had seen a problem and I had a solution. I mentioned it to many other friends whom upon presenting it to them, would strangely reply with a surprised expression of "Of all the ideas in the world, this one is the one that you want to embark on?". I even remember presenting it to my older sister. She gave me a big "OKAY? and CREEPY much".

I approached the approached the customer care desk in the administration building. After introducing myself and briefly starting to explain my idea, the customer care attendant interrupted as though not wanting to hear more and directed me to go through another door. I walked towards that door, feeling unappreciated.
